# 🧾 Interactive Form Validation

## 📌 Project Overview
**Interactive Form Validation** is a web-based project designed to ensure that user inputs in forms are valid, accurate, and complete before submission.  
This project demonstrates **real-time client-side validation** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It provides immediate feedback to users, improves data accuracy, and enhances the overall user experience.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Validate form inputs dynamically using JavaScript.  
- Provide **instant feedback** (error or success messages) for each field.  
- Prevent incorrect data from being submitted.  
- Demonstrate clean, responsive, and user-friendly form design.  
- Showcase interactive password strength checking and confirmation.

## 🧩 Key Features
✅ Real-time validation for all fields  
✅ Password strength meter and confirmation check  
✅ Instant inline error and success messages  
✅ Age and email format validation  
✅ Country selection and terms agreement validation  
✅ Responsive design for all screen sizes  
✅ Accessible and user-friendly interface

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
| Technology | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|
| **HTML5** | Structure of the form |
| **CSS3** | Styling and layout design |
| **JavaScript (ES6)** | Interactive validation and logic |

## 📋 Form Fields Validated
| Field Name | Validation Rule | Example |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| Full Name | Must not be empty and ≥ 3 characters | `John Doe` |
| Username | 3–20 characters, letters/numbers/._- only | `john_doe99` |
| Email | Must be in proper email format | `user@example.com` |
| Phone (optional) | Must contain 7–15 digits | `+91-9876543210` |

## 💻 How It Works
1. The user fills out the form fields.  
2. Each field is validated in **real-time** as the user types.  
3. If an input is invalid, an **error message** is displayed instantly.  
4. When all inputs are correct, the form shows **green success messages**.  
5. On submit, the JavaScript checks all fields again before final submission.
